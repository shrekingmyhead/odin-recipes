        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon whole milk</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon unsalted butter, sliced and softened</li>
            <li>⅝ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Step 1</h4>Grease an 8-inch square baking pan.</li>
            <li><h4>Step 2</h4>Place sugar and cocoa powder in a medium saucepan; pour in milk and stir until blended. Set heat to medium-high and stir constantly until mixture comes to a boil.</li>
            <li><h4>Step 3</h4>Reduce heat to low and place a candy thermometer in the pan. Let the mixture simmer without stirring until the temperature reaches 238 degrees F (114 degrees C) when measured with a candy thermometer, about 10 minutes. If you don't have a candy thermometer, drop a small amount of the mixture into cold water; if it forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface, it's ready.</li>
            <li><h4>Step 4</h4>Remove from the heat. Allow to cool to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), 50 to 70 minutes. Do not disturb fudge as it's cooling.</li>
            <li><h4>Step 5</h4>Add butter and vanilla to the fudge. Beat with a wooden spoon until well incorporated and fudge loses its sheen; do not under beat.</li>
            <li><h4>Step 6</h4>Pour fudge into prepared pan and press to flatten. Let cool at room temperature or in the refrigerator before cutting into 1-inch squares.</li>
        </ol>
